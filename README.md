## Setup for your event

This quick guide should help you to set up this app for your event, using GitHub and Heroku.

### Step 1: GitHub OAuth Setup

To set up Oauth with github, visit your the Oauth applications page of your GitHub Org, for example https://github.com/organizations/__YOUR_ORG__/settings/applications

Create a new application. For now, enter some random URL in the "Authorization callback URL" and the "Application URL" part. You have to update these a bit later, when the setup is ready.

When you've saved the new Application, it will show you your OAuth Secrets, similar to this.

These will be needed by the CFP vote app to authenticate your team members.

### Step 2: Set up the CFP Vote Service

Follow [this link](https://github.com/JSConfBp/cfp-vote-service) for instructions, the process is similar to this.

### Step 3: Set up the UI App

Fork this repo, then go to Heroku and create a new App there. Connect it to GitHub, you can turn on automatic deployments

If your App is connected to GitHub, go to it's Settings tab, and edit the config vars:

* **API_URL**  
the service url that you set up in Step 2
* **GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID**
* **GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET**  
these are displayed on your GitHub Org OAuth application page
* **GH_REDIRECT_URI**  
this should point to a path on this app, like this  
https://__HEROKU_APP_NAME__.herokuapp.com/oauth

If you've added these, go to the Deploy tab on Heroku, scroll to the bottom, and do a manual deploy .

### Do not forget to update your GitHub OAuth app URLs!

Go back to the OAuth settings on GitHub, and edit the URLs.

* your "Application URL" is the Heroku app url, something like this  
https://__HEROKU_APP_NAME__.herokuapp.com/

* the "Authorization callback URL" is the `/oauth` path on the app  
https://__HEROKU_APP_NAME__.herokuapp.com/oauth
